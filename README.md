# Demo game for 3D game engine

https://wiki.mozilla.org/Paladin/Workflow has our basic workflow.  

https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/337777 is where we're tracking user 
stories.

We've decided to use the gitflow branching conventions: feature branches for
individual features, the "develop" branch for integrating feature branches
together, and the "master" branch for tagged, production releases.

We expect to have live instances of both the develop and master branches
for playing up before too long.
